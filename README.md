## How to run

In order to run the game download the contents of the repository and open `index.html` in your internet browser. 

## Rules of the game

The aim of the game is to get to the water without colliding with the buggy enemies. In order to do that you need to move your player using keyboard arrows pointing `up`, `down`, `left` and `right`. If you collide with an enemy, the game is reset. If you reached the water, you've won the game and the winning message pops up. You can play again after closing the window.

## Contributing

This repository is my personal project, which is a part of Udacity Front End Web development nanodegree. In principal I would like to develop it on my own, but usefull tips and additions to the code are welcome.

## Possible upcoming additions

Possible interesting additions are:

* possibility to chose how the player looks
* a score counting the wins and collisions
* collectible items
* timer
* different difficulty levels after a certain score
